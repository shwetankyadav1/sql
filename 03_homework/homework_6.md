**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Most of my previous work has been theory filled technical studies in materials physics or chemistry, usually academic or R&D, and so was far removed from customers' private data or fields dealing with ethical issues and direct human impact. One area where researchers can be unethical is in falsifying results to help in easier publishing in journals, make a result more exciting or make a thesis more likely to be accepted. Furthermore, they have to follow the methodology and checks which they claim in their work, something which is rarily checked in peer-review publishing and works on trust (unless a major breakthrough which attracts attention), as is often brought up in the replication crises of the last few years. It was emphasized in my graduate studies by my supervisor to always follow procedures and follow the implication of our work, even it might be dissapointing when studying a new set of materials or not confirm our hypothesis. 

The other times ethics and inequity could show up in my previous work is in terms of other employees I worked with. This often involved dealing people from around the world with diverse backgrounds, sometimes adapting to cultural differences, although the main issue was usually just verbal language. Also treating others with respect, delivering on promised results (which they are relying on) in a timely manner, ensuring constant communication, voicing disagreements in a constructive and respectful manner, being up front about possible delays or inability to complete a task. Mostly, I felt everyone at work was respectful and truthful with few disagreemetns and did not witness any discrimination.
